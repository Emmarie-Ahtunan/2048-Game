# 2048-Game

The objective of the game is to move tiles with a goal of having them combine to make a tile with a value of two times the original. Tiles can be moved in 4 different directions, up, down, left, and right. If a tile is moved to a position that it already occupies, the tile will move to the next position in that direction. If a tile is moved to a position that is occupied by another tile, the tile will slide over to the next position in that direction. If a tile is moved to a position that is occupied by another tile and that tile has a value of four times the original, the original tile will be replaced by the new tile and will be removed from the board.
